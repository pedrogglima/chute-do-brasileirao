P.s For editing credentials, editor nano must be added (installed into image) to the docker file. e.g RUN apt update -qq && apt install -y vim nano (is already made)
P.s For editing the app image also need to have volume set up to the projects file. e.g (for docker compose) volumes: - .:/app

# visualize on console credentials
docker-compose exec app bin/rails credentials:show

# edit credentials
docker-compose run --rm -e EDITOR=nano app bin/rails credentials:edit

# for renovating credentials on project
 - Remove config/master.key and config/credentials.yml.enc
 - Run EDITOR=nano rails credentials:edit in the terminal: This command will create a new master.key and credentials.yml.enc if they do not exist.
